Description:
    The scaffold generator creates a controller to interact with a model.
    If the model does not exist, it creates the model as well.  The generated
    code is easy to migrate when you wish to customize your controller and views.

    The generator takes a model name, an optional controller name, and a
    list of views as arguments.  Scaffolded actions and views are created
    automatically.  Any views left over generate empty stubs.

    The scaffolded actions and views are:
        index, listing, show, add, create, edit, update, destroy

    If a controller name is not given, the plural form of the model name
    will be used.  The model and controller names may be given in CamelCase
    or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model' or 'Controller'.
    
Example:
    generate admin_scaffold Account Bank debit credit

    This will generate an Account model and BankController with a full test
    suite and a basic user interface.  Now create the accounts table in your
    database and browse to http://localhost/admin/bank/ -- voila.
